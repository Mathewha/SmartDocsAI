Detection area
The detection area is the place where vehicle detection and identification takes place. By design, the detection area covers the full cross-section of the road, i.e. all lanes where the tested devices are mounted, along with the emergency lane (if any). The system should be designed to ensure detection of all vehicles moving in a given direction.
In locations where there is an emergency lane, the detection area also includes the lane â€“ vehicles moving partially or completely in the emergency lane should be counted as vehicles passing in the slow lane unless the system design provides for a separate detection for the emergency lane.
On a road with two-way traffic, it is stipulated that all vehicles traveling in the indicated lane, in the specified direction, should be detected, even if they only partially pass over it. It is assumed that a vehicle should be detected when at least one wheel from each axle of the vehicle passes entirely in the indicated lane (within the area designated by horizontal markings). In such a measurement system, a vehicle is assumed to be outside the detection area when it has fully moved with all wheels into the opposite lane.
