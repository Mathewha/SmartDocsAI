Random variable
The result of each of the described tasks of the system, i.e. automatic detection, identification, classification, maker recognition – realized for a single vehicle – can be defined as success (correct result) or failure (incorrect result). The result is therefore a random variable with a binominal distribution with a parameter denoting the probability of success.
Thus, depending on the task, success is correct vehicle detection, correct license plate reading, correct type recognition, correct brand recognition. In each task, the count of vehicles must be taken into account, except that in the case of detection quality analysis it will be the number of all vehicles , and in the case of the other parameters , , the designated counts of vehicles , and must be taken into account.
