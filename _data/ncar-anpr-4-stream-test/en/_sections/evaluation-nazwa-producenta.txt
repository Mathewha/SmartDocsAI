Manufacturer name
In some situations, the manufacturer’s name needs to be disambiguated. This situation occurs when:
 the same manufacturer uses a different brand name in different regions (for example, “Opel” is used interchangeably with “Vauxhall”),
 the same manufacturer has transformed itself and changed its name over time (for example, “Citroen” has been producing cars under the name “DS” since June 1, 2016).
