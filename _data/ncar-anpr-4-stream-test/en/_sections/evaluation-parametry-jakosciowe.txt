Quality parameters
The following indicates the typical values of quality parameters that the tested system should achieve under optimal conditions:
 for vehicles observed from the front:
  - Parameter Label Level detection ≥97% identification ≥95% classification ≥90% maker ≥80%
 the required value of these parameters should be agreed with the Customer,
 for vehicles observed from the rear – quality parameters will be lower than for vehicles observed from the front.
 Attention
 Each of the above parameters should be determined at the confidence level = 95% .
