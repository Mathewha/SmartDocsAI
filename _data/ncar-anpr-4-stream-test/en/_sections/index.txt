Description of the quality verification procedure for the system implementing detection, classification and identification of vehicles from the video stream – license plate recognition (ANPR), vehicle type recognition and make and model recognition (MMR). The procedure is prepared for the free flow mode of operation, in which the input video stream is analyzed, and the result is a sequence – one data record for each vehicle passing in the field of view of the camera.
