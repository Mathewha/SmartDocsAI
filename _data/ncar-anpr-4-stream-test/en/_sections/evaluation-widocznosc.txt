Visibility
It is assumed that vehicle maker recognition is possible when the camera image contains a visible silhouette of the entire front of the vehicle. In particular, it is assumed that in addition to the license plate, fully visible should be:
 the right and left headlights of the vehicle,
 the area from the license plate to the lower edge of the windshield (horizontally, upward),
 the area from the license plate to the road surface (horizontally, downward).
Below is an image from the ANPR camera, in which a red box marks the section necessary for correct maker recognition.
If the front of the vehicles is not visible as in the example above, for example, it is partially obscured by other vehicles or infrastructure elements then such a case should be excluded from the evaluation.
