Detection quality
Detection level is a measure quantifying (in percentage terms) the ratio of the number of vehicles detected by the tested system to the number of all vehicles passing through a given detection area, at a given time, in a given direction, in a designated lane, at a speed that allows effective measurement. The detection level can be determined for vehicles moving in any direction or in a well-defined direction, rejecting vehicles moving against the flow, for example.
It is assumed that the system detects only moving vehicles – effective measurement is possible when the vehicle is moving at speed:
 at least ≥ 3.6 km/h (≥1 m/s),
 at most ≤ 252 km/h (≤70 m/s).
 Attention
 The vehicle speed requirement can be extended, for example, by allowing stop&go traffic, but it is recommended to treat such cases as special, tested in a separate procedure.
Two sources of error are taken into account in determining the detection level:
 – omission of a vehicle by the system (number of vehicles omitted),
 – detection of a non-existent vehicle by the system (number of falsely detected vehicles).
If is the number of vehicles that actually passed through the measurement point then the detection level is determined from the formula:
By design, the system should detect the passage of any vehicle, such as:
 motorcycles and mopeds,
 passenger cars, including those with trailers,
 light commercial vehicles (LCV), including those with trailers,
 tractors and other agricultural machinery, including multi-trailers,
 trucks, including those with trailers,
 tractor-trailers, stand-alone and with semi-trailer,
 buses, including those with trailers,
 special, multi-axle vehicles for oversize transport,
 military vehicles, including transporters and tanks.
When calculating the detection level, vehicles that the system may not detect are not taken into account:
 bicycles,
 mopeds,
 light wooden vehicles (such as a carriage),
 road machinery, such as rollers, milling machines, etc.
If multiple vehicles pass through the detection field at the same time, each should be detected independently.
