Confidence interval
The parameters tested (detection level, identification level, classification level, maker recognition efficiency) are the expressed percentage probabilities of .
In order to verify the requirements defined earlier, it is necessary:
 Adopt a specific confidence level for the assessment – most often:
 Calculate the estimate of of the given parameter under test.
 Calculate the lower value of the symmetric confidence interval calculated using Wilson’s [2] method:
  – gdzie wartość wynika z przyjętego poziomu ufności, a rzeczywista wartość testowanego parametru jest z prawdopodobieństwem 95% wyższa od wartości .
  – due to the fact that the requirement is for the value of in the calculation of is taken double the value of the assumed confidence level, which in this case is 90%.
 Verify that the value of is greater than the threshold value given in the requirements section.Verify that the value of is greater than the threshold value given in the requirements section.
