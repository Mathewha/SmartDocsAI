Formal verification
Formal verification is carried out by the Customer upon receipt of the report, and consists of:
 Verification of data completeness (video + raw data),
 Verification of data compliance with the procedure â€“ evaluation of sample selection,
 Verification of data submission deadlines.
If at the stage of formal verification the Customer discovers inaccuracies, they should be clarified by the Provider in writing.
Finally, the Customer informs the Provider that the submitted materials were accepted / rejected for formal reasons.
