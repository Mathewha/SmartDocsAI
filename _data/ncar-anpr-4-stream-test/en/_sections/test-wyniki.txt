Results
The detection, identification and classification quality will be determined for all measurements combined. In the case of evaluating maker recognition performance, a 1000-element sample formed by concatenating DAM500 and DPM500 samples should be taken.
The results should be tabulated with an indication:
 how many vehicles from a given sample were included in the evaluation
 how many vehicles have correctly recognized parameters,
 what is the average value of a given quality factor,
 what is the statistically reliable value of a given quality factor.
An example of the final statement is shown below:
