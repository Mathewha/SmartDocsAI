Classification quality
Classification quality, or vehicle type recognition quality , is a measure quantifying (in percentage terms) the ratio of the number of correctly recognized vehicle types to the number of all classifiable vehicles that passed through the detection area within a specified time, at the correct speed and in the direction according to the systemâ€™s configuration (in particular, the system can be adapted to recognize in a given detection area vehicle types coming from one specific direction):
The number of vehicles that can be classified in a specific series of vehicles is determined by an expert during the test. Vehicles are not taken into account:
 bicycles,
 mopeds,
 light wooden vehicles (such as a carriage),
 road machinery like rollers, milling machines, etc.,
 vehicles that the expert is unable to assign to any of the classes recognized by the system.
The system must be able to recognize the following classes of vehicles:
 personal car
 LCV (light commercial vehicle)
 trucks (vehicles with GVW >3.5 tons and truck tractors),
 buses
