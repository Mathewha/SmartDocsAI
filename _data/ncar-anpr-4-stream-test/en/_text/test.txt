 Conditions
It is assumed that the system should identify vehicles at the expected level of quality at any time of day or night (except for brand recognition, where only daytime operation is allowed) in any weather conditions. However, the exception is when one of the factors occurs:
 a significant number of vehicles travel at speeds outside the permissible range (e.g., passing out of traffic jams),
 snowfall occurs,
 the ambient air temperature drops below 0° C, which can lead to icing on the number plates and reduce their readability,
 there is a strong atmospheric anomaly in the form of a thunderstorm with hail,
 there is a strong atmospheric anomaly in the form of a dust storm.
If any of the above factors occur during the test, the test should be suspended and rescheduled for another convenient date.
 Sample
In order to obtain a statistically reliable result for the test values, it is expected that the test sample size must be no smaller than 1,200 vehicles.
This sample should be divided into three sub-sets:
 DAM500 – 500 vehicles registered during the day, before noon,
 DPM500 – 500 vehicles registered during the day, in the afternoon,
 N200 – 200 vehicles registered at night.
Day should be understood as the period from the beginning of the astronomical day (astronomical sunrise) +1 hour, to the end of the astronomical day (astronomical sunset) -1 hour. Night should be understood as the period of 2 hours after astronomical sunset and up to 2 hours before astronomical sunrise.
The phrase before noon means at least 1 hour before astronomical noon while the phrase after noon means at least 1 hour after astronomical noon. The determination of astronomical sunrise, sunset and noon is made on the basis of information about the measurement location and the relevant astronomical tables. The calculated values are entered into the test protocol.
 Video recording
It is required that video footage covering at least the entire field of view of the ANPR camera be recorded while the test is being conducted. The video should be recorded in digital form, compressed (H.264), with a resolution of at least 640 × 360, 25 frames per second. The reference video recording can come directly from the ANPR camera or from a nearby camera facing the test area.
It is assumed that the video recording should be continuous throughout the sub-test period. It is permissible that there will be gaps in the video material, however, they must not exceed more than 1% of the required recording time, with the length of one gap not exceeding 0.5 s.
 Source data
It is required that source data generated by the system under test be collected during the test. For each recorded vehicle trip, this data should include:
 Metadata :
    timestamp, with an accuracy of at least 0.1 s,
    the unique identifier of the measurement site,
    ANPR recognition result in test form,
    type recognition result in test form,
    the result of maker recognition in the test form.
 Pictures :
    photo of the entire detection are – the ANPR camera snapshot,
    a snap of the photo containing the front of the vehicle - allowing to assess the correctness of maker recognition,
    a snap of the photo containing the entire license plate (including its surround/frame) – the characters in this slice should be at least 16 px .
 Procedure
The test will be conducted in three stages, separately for the DAM500 , DPM500 and N200 sub-sets.
In the first step, the time for performing the test for each sample must be specified. Then, at the specified time, at least as many vehicles as provided for each sample should be registered consecutively, with the proviso that if an unidentifiable vehicle appears during registration (in any of the evaluated criteria) then the sample will be increased by one.
All vehicles excluded from the test must be included in the test report (in the form of a photo), and in addition, for each such case it is necessary to comment on what basis the exclusion was decided.
Each vehicle in the sample must have its own unique sequence number, and all vehicles in the sample must be numbered monotonically increasing with respect to time.
Shortly after the collection of a given sample, the source data and video recording should be digitally signed (the time signature of the signature is important here) and forwarded to the verification committee, with the time from the completion of the sample recording to the handover of the printed documentation not to exceed three hours, under the sanction of classifying the sample as “wholly misrecognized”.
 Processed data
After collecting all samples ( DAM500 , DPPM00 , N200 ), the contractor shall prepare a tabular summary of all source data. Such a summary should be placed in a table saved as a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel / LibreOffice Calc), where each recorded vehicle passage should be placed in a separate row. The table with processed data should contain at least such columns:
  Name Format Example Description
  counter number 1 sequential number of the vehicle in the list, numbered from 1
  terminal text ncar-h-cpu-06c00103 serial number / unique identifier of the data generating device
  date date 2022-10-27 date based on timestamp, local time, displayed in YYYY-MM-DD format
  time date 09:00:00 time based on timestamp, local time, displayed in HH:MM:SS format
  ms number 960 millisecond based on the timestamp
  place text pl-wrozyczliwa-wja-l1 the unique identifier of the location where the vehicle was registered
  class number 7 recognized vehicle type, according to the taxonomy under test (e.g., TLS 5+1)
  number text DW6C448 recognized, normalized registration number
  maker text BMW maker’s name recognized
  model text 4 recognized model version (if available)
  det_ok number +1 whether the detection of a particular vehicle is correct ?
  class_ok number +1 is the vehicle class recognized correctly ?
  maker_ok number +1 is the maker recognized correctly ?
  anpr_ok number +1 is the vehicle registration number recognized correctly ?
  notice text comments (if any)
In the det_ok , class_ok , maker_ok and anpr_ok columns, the entered numeric values are interpreted as follows:
  Value Meaning
  +1 indicated value is correct, vehicle takes part in the evaluation
  -1 indicated value is incorrect, vehicle takes part in the evaluation
  0 the measurement record in question is excluded from the evaluation
A template for such a table is included as Appendix A to this document.
 Results
The detection, identification and classification quality will be determined for all measurements combined. In the case of evaluating maker recognition performance, a 1000-element sample formed by concatenating DAM500 and DPM500 samples should be taken.
The results should be tabulated with an indication:
 how many vehicles from a given sample were included in the evaluation
 how many vehicles have correctly recognized parameters,
 what is the average value of a given quality factor,
 what is the statistically reliable value of a given quality factor.
An example of the final statement is shown below:
 Report
The summary of the test is the preparation of a report (in PDF format) by the provider, which includes:
 Information about the business project under which the test was conducted,
 information about the device under test,
 information about the location,
 information about the selected moments when the data were acquired ( DAM500 , DPM500 , N200 ),
 summary of results in accordance with Section 4.7,
 analysis of the results - determining whether the test was successful in each area tested.
 Attention
 The report should be prepared and delivered to the customer no later than 5 working days from the date of submission of source data.
