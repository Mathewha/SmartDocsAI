 Formal verification
Formal verification is carried out by the Customer upon receipt of the report, and consists of:
 Verification of data completeness (video + raw data),
 Verification of data compliance with the procedure – evaluation of sample selection,
 Verification of data submission deadlines.
If at the stage of formal verification the Customer discovers inaccuracies, they should be clarified by the Provider in writing.
Finally, the Customer informs the Provider that the submitted materials were accepted / rejected for formal reasons.
 Substantive verification
Substantive verification consists in the Customer’s evaluation of the materials provided by the Provider in terms of:
 Completeness of vehicle detection – based on video provided raw + tabular data,
 the correctness of assessing the attributes of individual vehicle traces,
 the correctness of the evaluation of the calculated quality measures,
 compliance of the determined quality measures with the established requirements.
The Customer may ask the Provider to clarify or supplement or correct the processed data provided.
 Test acceptance
The Customer accepts the test on the basis of the results of formal verification and substantive verification – acceptance means that the Provider has met all formal and substantive criteria contained in the requirements. Acceptance is required in writing.
 Test repetition
If, for formal or substantive reasons, the test is not accepted, the Provider has the right to repeat the test once again. Re-testing should be agreed upon with the Customer.
