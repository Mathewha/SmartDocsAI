Usage
The shot-vi module does not have any graphical user interface by default. The moduleâ€™s functions are invoked by calling the corresponding RestAPI method with an argument in the form of a photo in JPEG or PNG format:
The user can add a dedicated set of parameters (e.g., specific to a given image) to the call. Such parameters are then placed as an argument in the URL to the HTTP post method.
A complete description of the data structures and RestAPI interface for the application can be found at the publicly available link:
