Processing
The shot-vi module can process simultaneously multiple input images given by separate API calls. Each image is processed in a separate thread. This makes parallel processing possible â€“ processing multiple images simultaneously at the same time. The limitation in this case is the number of threads available on a given computer or license restrictions.
The average processing time of one photo significantly depends on its content. For simple cases (one vehicle with a clear plate) it is about 200 milliseconds . For images from speed cameras, where there are many vehicles and there is a need for recognition from reflections, the average time is 2 seconds but under special conditions this time can be extended even to 10 seconds (more vehicles in the image, larger). Time measurements were made for a processor of the Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2660 class clocked at a base frequency of 2.2 GHz. For variants running on ARM processors, processing times are longer.
