Version EN 4.0.2 released on Oct 23, 2020.
NeuroCar ANPR Camera – Model 4 is a universal system designed to detect and identify vehicles based on video analysis. The camera processes the video stream, automatically detects each vehicle and identifies it by license plate recognition (ANPR). Additionally, the vehicle class, manufacturer, model version and colour are also recognized. The camera can operate indoors and outdoors, 24/7 (day-night), in extreme weather conditions without external light sources. Thanks to its low power consumption and low power supply voltage, the device can operate on batteries.
  Functions
   Function name Availability Description
   Vehicle detection standard > 98%, for vehicle speed in the range 0÷250 km/h, based on the video stream ( free flow ), the licence plate must be visible and legible
   Vehicle detection without plate option > 99%, for vehicle speed in the range of 0÷250 km/h, based on the video stream
   Detection of dangerous goods option > 90%, ADR plates, “Odpady”, “A”
   Detection of direction standard > 99%, vehicle reverses = -1, vehicle approaches = 1, unknown direction = 0
   Stop detection standard yes, multiple recognition filter ( stop-and-go )
   Number of lanes standard 1÷3 - recognition for 3 lanes only if the camera is placed above the centre lane
   Lane detection standard yes
   Number plate recognition standard > 97% for all detected vehicles with a human-readable registration number, region selection: EU , LA , NE .
   Country of origin recognition option > 97% for all vehicles with a recognised registration number, 48 countries simultaneously (including entire Europe)
   Vehicle classification (AVC) option > 92%, classes: car (7), van (11), truck (3), bus (5), motorcycle (10); for front view only, additional IR illuminator required in case of insufficient lighting (e.g. at night)
   Maker recognition option > 90%, recognition of makers such as “bmw”, “audi”, etc.; only for frontal detection; additional IR illuminator required at night
   Model recognition option > 80%, recognition of make and models such as “bmw 5”, “audi Q5”; only for frontal detection; additional IR illuminator required at night
   Speed measurement option ±10% accuracy for all vehicles with recognised number plates, after automatic calibration
  Attention
  All quality parameters are given as maximum values and are determined for optimum location and configuration of the unit (see Mounting instructions ).
