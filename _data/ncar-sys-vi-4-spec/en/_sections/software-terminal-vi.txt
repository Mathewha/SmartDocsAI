Terminal VI
This is a dedicated firmware for devices performing terminal functions â€“ the software controls all functions of the device ensuring continuous 24/7 operation. In particular, it controls camera parameters, controls the status of storage media, controls time synchronization, manages communication modules and controls data transmission to the host system.
The firmware has a built-in graphical interface (GUI) accessible through any web browser supporting HTML-5. Using it, the operator can monitor the status of the device, can view measurement data (registered vehicles) in real time. The GUI also allows managing access privileges.
The firmware also has RestAPI implemented, allowing the device to be accessed and controlled by an automated higher-level system.
