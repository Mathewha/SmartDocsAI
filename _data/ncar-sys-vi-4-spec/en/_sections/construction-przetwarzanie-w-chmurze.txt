Cloud computing
In such a configuration, cameras are mounted at the point of detection (on the road) to provide a video stream to the central system. These cameras are adapted for vehicle detection and identification (type: ANPR camera ), however, since they do not analyze video, they must be connected to the central system with a relatively good and wide communication link – with a bandwidth of several Mbps.
The video stream is fed to a cloud-based application NeuroCar Stream VI – a separate instance of the stream engine is launched for each camera, which analyzes the stream and forwards (to BackOffice ) only information about detected vehicles ( VehicleTrace data record). The measurement data can only be accessed via BackOffice ; either through the corresponding GUI application or by sending out notifications.
Thanks to the use of Kubernetes technology, such a solution can be run in virtually any cloud (either in a private → on premise , or with a third-party cloud provider). In addition, scaling is very easy – increasing the number of cameras is implemented only by adding working nodes in the cluster.
