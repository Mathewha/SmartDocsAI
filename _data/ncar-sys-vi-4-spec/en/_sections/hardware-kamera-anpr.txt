ANPR camera
The ANPR camera is a digital camera that provides a video stream suitable for license plate detection and license plate recognition. This camera has specific features:
 image resolution of at least HD (1280×720p)
 high sensitivity of the CMOS sensor allowing good (bright) images at shutter speed ≤1 millisecond,
 the ability to provide both color (day) and monochrome (night) images,
 switchable “day / night” modes – switchable, mechanical infrared filter,
 motorized lens or a motorized CMOS sensor position control system that allows remote focusing without physical access to the camera,
 a good-quality infrared-corrected lens with a focal length that allows the field of view to be set to 1÷3 lanes, with automatic iris control,
 built-in infrared illuminator that allows proper operation at night (invisible light in the range of 850÷940 nm),
 encryption of the connection to the client software, using SSL/TLS and X.509 certificates,
 the ability to enforce authentication ( user | pass ) by which it is protected from unauthorized use,
 H.264 video streaming with adjustable stream quality,
 built-in interface for diagnostics (SNMP),
 time synchronization capability, e.g. via NTP,
 specialized housing that reduces fogging of the windshield and has a shield against direct contact with sunlight,
 a suitable mounting bracket with precise adjustment of the camera position in at least 2 axes.
 Attention
 The ANPR camera does not process the video stream, i.e. it has no built-in processor for data analysis.
