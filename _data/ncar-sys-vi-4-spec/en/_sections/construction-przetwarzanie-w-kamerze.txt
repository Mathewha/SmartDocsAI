Edge computing
In such a configuration, smart cameras are mounted at the point of detection (on the road), equipped with a motorized lens and a built-in infrared illuminator, provided with a built-in single-chip computer that processes the video stream. In addition, the smart camera has a built-in data storage device (SSD drive) for buffering measurements, and a modem - all in one compact enclosure.
The smart camera functionally corresponds to the terminal configuration, but it is more compact and smaller, and therefore easier to install, deploy and maintain. The disadvantage of a smart camera is the very limited possibility of creating multi-sensor measurement systems, which means that it is most often used when the user only needs the functionality of identifying vehicles “from a single shot”. The advantage of a smart camera is the ability to process images without distortion (e.g., without compression) which is due to the fact that the camera’s built-in CPU is physically integrated into the video path.
Another device that implements the instant processing concept is a smartphone that is both a camera and a processing unit. Such a phone, like a smart camera, analyzes the video stream, detects vehicles, identifies them and sends the result immediately to the central system.
