Alerts
AUXILIARY
Based on the data on registered vehicles, it is possible to define alerts on the passage of a vehicle with the indicated characteristics, such as a wanted vehicle (indicated registration number) or a prohibited vehicle (i.e. vehicle of the “truck” class). Alerts can be generated on the terminal or in the central system.
The alert can be sent asynchronously to the host system as a notification immediately after being created. The form of the alert is configurable.
