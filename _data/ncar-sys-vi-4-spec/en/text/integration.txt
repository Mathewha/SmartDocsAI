7. Integration
**************


7.1. API
========

Use of terminal (camera) as well as central system functions possible
through the RestAPI interface, for which the full specification –
*NeuroCar API* – is available free of charge at:

   https://gitlab.com/ncar-tools/04/api

The various functions of the system (e.g., data access, measurement
record format, user management) are described using the OpenAPI 3
standard.


7.2. Notifications
==================

Both the terminal (camera) and the central system can actively
transmit information to master systems using the notification
mechanism (*push technology*) in asynchronous mode.


7.2.1. Data
-----------

All data records (measurements, camera images, status) can be sent via
the HTTP(s) protocol using "GET", "PUT" or "POST" commands. The
content of the data record is appended to the message in the form of a
TAR file, which includes all elements such as metadata along with
images.


7.2.2. Notifications
--------------------

The system can be configured to send notifications (e.g., information
about events such as a wanted vehicle) using:

* e-mail (SMTP e-mail server must be available),

* SMS (an SMS gateway must be available).


7.3. Import
===========

The BackOffice central system has the ability to connect external data
sources (e.g., data from third-party ANPR cameras) via **Importer**
(*pulling*) or **Receiver** (*pushing*) modules. The task of these
modules is to transform the data into a unified form compliant with
the API specification.
