1. Operating principle
**********************

The **NeuroCar - Vehicle Identification** (*NeuroCar VI*) system is
used for automatic detection and identification of vehicles by
analyzing the video stream provided by the camera. The basic way of
identification is recognition of the license plate - in the extended
version it is also possible to automatically recognize the category of
the vehicle, its make (model version), speed and country of origin.

A vehicle driving within the field of view of the camera is
automatically detected, and then the license plate is recognized and
retrieved at various points (shots). As a result, a measurement record
containing a picture of the vehicle and various types of data
extracted from image analysis is stored in the system's memory.

The data collected by the measuring devices is stored in a central
system (*BackOffice*) installed in the cloud, with the help of which
users can comfortably search and analyze this data. The central system
also has diagnostic functions to improve control of the correct
operation of the measurement infrastructure.

Thanks to its modular design and the use of open protocols, easy
integration is possible â€“ users can add their own data sources or can
attach their own processes to the system using information collected
in the central system - through WEB API.
