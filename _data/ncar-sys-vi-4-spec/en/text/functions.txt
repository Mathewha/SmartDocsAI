2. Functions
************

The functions delivered by the system can be divided into three
groups:

+----------------+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Label          | Function            | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
|================|=====================|====================================================================================================================================================================|
| "BASIC"        | **basic**           | the main functions for which the system is built (*key functions*)                                                                                                 |

+----------------+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


2.1. Detection
==============

"BASIC"

It consists of automatic detection of the vehicle passing within the
camera's field of view (*free-flow*). The camera should be positioned
in such a way that the license plate number can be read. Detection
works for vehicles observed from both the front and rear, regardless
of the driving direction. The detector selects from the video stream
one shot (snapshot) in which the detected vehicle is most clearly
visible → it has a legible license plate and the image of the driver
can be seen.

"EXTENDED"

In the extended configuration, it is possible to detect vehicles
without a license plate, or whose plate is unrecognizable - such a
mechanism is called *VLOOP* → *virtual loop*.


2.2. Registration number
========================

"BASIC"

It consists of automatic detection of the location of the license
plate in the processed image and reading its content. The result of
recognition is a string of alphanumeric characters, including special
diacritics found in some countries – e.g. Ä, Ë, Ö, etc. The recognized
string of characters also includes a space, which represents each
separator. The result of the recognition is also information about the
position and size of the array in the source image.

"EXTENDED"

In addition to the sequence of characters, the system can also
determine the type of plate based on its syntax. This makes it
possible to additionally mark the vehicle, for example, as a
privileged vehicle (in Poland this is the appropriate prefix), or
place of registration (city code). Individual plates are also
recognized.


2.3. Class
==========

"EXTENDED"

It consists of automatic recognition of the vehicle class based solely
on the photo. The system can distinguish the following classes:

+----------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Code     | Meaning                                           |
|==========|===================================================|
| **0**    | unknown ( category determination was not          |
|          | possible)                                         |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **3**    | truck                                             |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **5**    | bus                                               |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **7**    | car                                               |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **10**   | motorcycle (only when *VLOOP* is active)          |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **11**   | delivery van up to 3.5 t                          |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+

Determining the vehicle class from the image requires that the
silhouette of the front (or rear) of the vehicle is visible in the
image. The problem can be night conditions, where the camera provides
a picture of the plate taken in infrared - except the plate nothing is
visible. If the prerequisite is to recognize the category also at
night it is necessary to use additional special illumination.


2.4. Make and model
===================

"EXTENDED"

It consists of automatically recognizing the manufacturer and its
model version based solely on a photo of the vehicle. The algorithm
works for photos taken from the front and rear of the vehicle - so
that the license plate is visible. The recognition result is two text
labels: *manufacturer name* + *model name*, for example *audi* + *q5*.
The system recognizes ~140 different manufacturers and nearly 1,900
different models.


2.5. Color
==========

"EXTENDED"

It involves automatically estimating the color of a vehicle based on
the front image. Color determination works only for daytime images
when the camera is in color mode. Color recognition can be affected by
the "white balance" mechanism and depends on the type of camera used.
The result of the recognition operation is the name of the primary
color:

+-------------+--------------+
| Code        | Meaning      |
|=============|==============|
| *yellow*    | yellow       |
+-------------+--------------+
| *red*       | red          |
+-------------+--------------+
| *green*     | green        |
+-------------+--------------+
| *blue*      | blue         |
+-------------+--------------+
| black       | black        |
+-------------+--------------+
| *grey*      | grey         |
+-------------+--------------+

In addition, modifications "dark" and "light" are added to the base
color.


2.6. Direction
==============

"BASIC"

By analyzing image sequence, the direction of vehicle movement can be
determined – the system determines the direction value by generating
the following values:

+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code   | Meaning                                                                           |
|========|===================================================================================|
| +1     | Conforms to the expected direction of traffic in that lane                        |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0      | Unspecified, possibly vehicle is standing                                         |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -1     | Opposite of the expected direction of traffic in this lane - the vehicle is       |
|        | driving upstream                                                                  |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


2.7. Lane
=========

"BASIC"

Traffic lanes are determined by indicating the line of separation
between lanes in the camera frame. At the configuration stage, you can
define the number of lanes the camera observes (1÷4). A label is also
attached to each lane: "L0", "L1", "L2" ..., which is then used in the
measurement metadata. The following convention is applied:

+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code      | Meaning                                                                              |
|===========|======================================================================================|
| "L0"      | shoulder (mostly non-existent)                                                       |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| "L1"      | slow lane, in Europe the rightmost (always present)                                  |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| "L2"      | "overtaking" lane, in Europe to the left of the "L1" lane (may not be present)       |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| "L3"      | "overtaking" lane, in Europe to the left of the "L2" lane (may not be present)       |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ...       |                                                                                      |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

For countries with left-hand traffic, the convention is similar except
that the "L1" lane is the leftmost lane.


2.8. Country
============

"EXTENDED"

The country of origin of the vehicle is determined based on geometric
features and the contents of the license plate. The system is adapted
to simultaneously recognize numbers from multiple countries, but the
user must select one of the following regions – recognition is limited
to countries from that region only:

+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code      | Meaning                                                                      |
|===========|==============================================================================|
| *AFRI*    | Africa [1]                                                                   |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *AMEC*    | Central America [1]                                                          |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *AMEN*    | North America [2] (United States, Canada)                                    |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *AMES*    | South America [1]                                                            |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *ASIA*    | Asia [2]                                                                     |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *AUOC*    | Australia and Oceania [3]                                                    |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *EURO*    | Europe                                                                       |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *MIDE*    | Middle East [1]                                                              |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The country of origin is indicated using a two-letter country code
according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 - for example, "PL" means *Poland*.

2.9. Speed
==========

"EXTENDED"

The speed of the vehicle is calculated on the basis of analysis of
displacements of the position of the center of the license plate in
successive frames of the video stream. The system has a mechanism for
automatically determining, necessary for recalculation, parameters of
the measurement system (camera position relative to, viewing angle,
magnification, etc.) so that the user does not need to provide such
data during installation.

The speed calculation accuracy in this way depends on many factors and
is generally used for statistical purposes – it cannot be used, for
example, for the purpose of violations enforcement.


2.10. Dangerous goods
=====================

"EXTENDED"

Vehicles carrying dangerous goods are identified based on detection
and recognition of the contents of an ADR plate, which should be
mounted on the front or rear of the vehicle. Such a placard is placed
on vehicles in countries that are signatories to the International
Convention on the Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Cargoes by Road (fr.
L'Accord européen relatif au transport international des marchandises
Dangereuses par Route).

The ADR plate contains two codes (recognized by the system), which
specify the hazard identification number and the material
identification number. In addition, the system detects the presence of
so-called "blank ADR plates", as well as plates indicating the
carriage of waste (the texts "Odpady" and "A").


2.11. Multivision
=================

"EXTENDED"

The system can consider measurement configurations in which multiple
cameras observe a same detection location. It can then happen that the
same vehicle is detected and identified by several cameras
simultaneously. This applies to configurations in which, for example,
two cameras observe exactly the same point, or two cameras observe
both the front and rear of the same vehicle.

[image: multivision][image]

In both cases, the system is able to combine measurements from
individual cameras and ultimately generates detection and
identification information for only one vehicle.


2.12. Alerts
============

"AUXILIARY"

Based on the data on registered vehicles, it is possible to define
alerts on the passage of a vehicle with the indicated characteristics,
such as a wanted vehicle (indicated registration number) or a
prohibited vehicle (i.e. vehicle of the "truck" class). Alerts can be
generated on the terminal or in the central system.

The alert can be sent asynchronously to the host system as a
notification immediately after being created. The form of the alert is
configurable.


2.13. Monitoring
================

"AUXILIARY"

Monitoring the health of elements of the measurement infrastructure is
a key sentence from the perspective of data reliability. A two-way
health control mechanism is implemented in the system:

* **push** - periodic transmission by selected devices (terminals) of
  information about their status, to the central system → "status",

* **pull** - periodic querying by the central system of the status of
  all devices impacting the health of the measurement infrastructure.

The aforementioned dual methodology makes it possible to react quickly
to faults but also to review records of the system's operating history
and detect disturbances caused by temporary malfunctions of measuring
devices.
