FoV height
Setting the height of the FoV depends on two factors:
 minimum character height (described in the next section),
 maximum vehicle speed (combined with the number of frames per second - FPS).
The ANPR engine requires that for a given vehicle passage in the field of view, the license plate must be visible (recognized) at least twice. This means that the FoV at altitude must cover a sufficiently large stretch of road for the license plate to be visible (legible) twice at maximum speed. At the same time, other requirements should be met.
In this case, the user can modify the zoom, angle and FPS of the camera.
