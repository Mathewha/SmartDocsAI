Frames per second
It is recommended to use the following settings:
 25 fps - HDR X - For access control and parking lot applications,
 30 fps - HDR X - For monitoring urban traffic.
For vehicle detection on highways, it may be advisable to live 50 fps settings, however - this depends on the geometry of the measurement point and may cause problems due to the cameraâ€™s limited ability to compensate for different lighting conditions.
