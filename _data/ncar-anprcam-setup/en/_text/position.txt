When selecting a mounting point for an ANPR camera, consider the guidelines described in the following subsections.
 Height
The position of the camera should be chosen so that the movement of the license plate can be observed as the vehicle passes by. Therefore, it is recommended that the camera be mounted at a height slightly above the roof of the vehicle:
Mounting height depends on the availability of mounting structures, and in practice this means:
 Warning
 Mounting the camera too low (e.g., at the level of the vehicle’s roof) will cause the camera to be blinded at night by the car’s headlights, and will also make it impossible to analyze the vehicle’s movement (e.g., detecting direction or determining speed).
 Distance
The distance from the camera to the detection line (see point Detection line ) is directly derived from the installation height . The optimum distance is the distance for which the angle between the optical axis of the camera and the path plane is .
For example, for the mounting height can be calculated:
The angle of can be adjusted to the conditions of a particular measurement system, but should be within the range:
 Warning
 If the angle is too small ( ), overshadowing of vehicles driving behind one another may occur. If the angle is too large ( ), the geometry of the license plate will be disturbed – and at night, the light from the infrared illuminator will not reflect properly, impairing vehicle detection.
The following table indicates the optimal distance with respect to the camera mounting height. For the indicated height, the minimum and maximum distance resulting from angle constraints are also indicated:

To ensure reliable recognition, the focal length of the camera lens should be sufficient to achieve the required number of pixels for the character (see Character size ).
 Angle
The ANPR camera can be mounted in the lane or at the edge of the lane:
It is important that the horizontal angle between the optical axis of the camera and the axis of the road is not greater than :
 Warning
 If the is outside the indicated range, the image distortion may result in poor detection quality (the characters on the license plate will be too narrow), and the IR illumination will not be adequate (too little reflected light).
 Tilt
When setting up the ANPR camera, pay attention to proper leveling - the longer edge of the license plate should be parallel to the horizontal edge of the camera’s field of view:
It is recommended that the angle of the be within the range of , but it must be within the range:
To achieve this, you may need to use special camera mounting brackets or camera leveling pads.
