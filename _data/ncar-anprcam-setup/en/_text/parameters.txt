Internal camera settings also affect the quality of recognition - in particular, consider:
 LPR mode
It is recommended that the cameras operate in LPR mode 24 hours a day:
 Frames per second
It is recommended to use the following settings:
 25 fps - HDR X - For access control and parking lot applications,
 30 fps - HDR X - For monitoring urban traffic.
For vehicle detection on highways, it may be advisable to live 50 fps settings, however - this depends on the geometry of the measurement point and may cause problems due to the camera’s limited ability to compensate for different lighting conditions.
 Exposure time
It is recommended that the exposure time meet the following requirements:
 < 1000 ms – for access control systems and parking lot applications,
 < 600 ms – for other applications.
 Warning
 It is recommended that the ANPR camera automatically adjust the exposure time according to the lighting conditions.
 Illumination
The recommended illumination settings depend on how far the camera is from the vehicle . If the is relatively small, it may be necessary to reduce the intensity level to prevent overexposure of the license plate at night.
